# Overview
Built a message board application to practice using Angular and MongoDB, and to practice quickly spinning up/completing a project in a challenge environment. 

## Instructions
The message board application you are going to build has the following requirements:

MUST use Angular and MongoDB

Your Front End should have two inputs. One for the user's name, the other for the user's message. Additionally, there should be a submit button,

When the submit button is clicked, you must send the name and message from the inputs to the server to be written to a Mongo Database

Once the message has been successfully written to the database, display all messages on the DOM,

If the application page is reloaded, all previous messages should appear.
